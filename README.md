# Password Strength Checker

## Description
This project is a Password Strength Checker implemented using Python and Tkinter. It evaluates the strength of a password based on its length, complexity, and entropy. The checker provides feedback on how to improve the password and ensures it is not among common passwords.

## Features
- Checks password length and complexity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
- Provides feedback to improve password strength.
- Checks against a list of common passwords.
- Calculates and displays password entropy.
- Simple and user-friendly GUI using Tkinter.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abubakker-98/Pa-word_-tr3nth_Ch3ck3r
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Pa-word_-tr3nth_Ch3ck3r
    ```

3. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

4. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    pip install tk
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the `password_strength_checker.py` script:
    ```bash
    python Pa-word_-tr3nth_Ch3ck3r.py
    ```

2. Enter a password in the input field and click the "Check Strength" button.

3. The GUI will display the strength of the password, feedback for improvement, and the entropy value.

## File Descriptions
